I started by creating two empty lists. I then asked the user for the number students they want to enter.I then used the range function and asked the user to input the student's height in feet as float. I then used the input as elements in my lists and used the multiplied each element with 30.48 in order to convert the heights into centimetres.I then appended the and stored the floor of the resulting floats in one decimal place. Finally I printed both the lists of heights in feet and in centimetres for each student.
